<p>My first topic idea is to write about the topic of coding itself and how it can be integrated into any academic study. Numerous times when I&#39;ve told friends that I&#39;m taking a coding class this semester they respond with some version of &quot;Why? Aren&#39;t you a Public Relations major?&quot;  Well to answer their question yes, I am; but does that matter?  In this day and age it&#39;s constantly stressed that people need to be versatile in their skill-set.  At the same time, the need for individuals with computer skills is on the rise.  I already know my friends who are Computer Science majors will likely make double the salary I do and that&#39;s ok; but why shouldn&#39;t I take advantage of the opportunity to learn a bit of coding while I too have the chance?  I want to write my paper about how coding can be useful to any major, the doors that open up from having even a minor working understanding of coding concepts, and how it could potentially set you apart from other applicants when in the job application process.</p>
<p>My second topic idea is to write about the importance of branding in website development.  I&#39;ll be honest I am not vastly as interested in this topic as the former one; however, for the sake of presenting two options I chose this.  I think it could be interesting to look at how individuals not only code websites to be unique in this ever-expanding digital age, but how branding comes in to play in the overall process.  I guess this topic could even expand to include the increasing development of new coding ideas and how branding and coding are both moving into the keep-up-or-become-irrelevant mindset.</p>
